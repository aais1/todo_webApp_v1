# todo_webApp_v1
This is a simple To-Do App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows you to create and manage your to-do list right in your web browser.
Please note that this app doesn't have a backend, so your to-do items won't be saved after you close/refresh the browser.

#Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

#NOTE
This is only meant to be a small front end project and this is just the first version i will try to improve it in future :D..

#Collaborate
I would appreciate anyone who would improve/add more code to this existing project :)
